Online-only journals are exceedingly common today, if not the norm, and few subscribe to print versions of journals anymore. As a result of this paradigm shift in scientific publishing, it is easier than ever to directly claim credit for your work on accounts that you can manage. Citation tracking platforms provide a means of easy access for readers to your entire body of scientific contributions, increasing exposure of your work.</p> <p>However, these systems are imperfect. They may erroneously include papers attributed to you that are not your work, or fail to include papers that are. Unless your parents tried way too hard when naming you, there are plenty of other scientists that share your name. Thus, manual curation is required to ensure that these pages accurately represent your works.</p> <h1 id="common-platforms-to-curate">Common platforms to curate</h1> <p>Below is a list of some of the most common platforms that track scientific publications for researchers. The depth of coverage for citations on each article varies between sites, with Google Scholar generally having the most extensive coverage. It is worth noting that most sites are also rather opaque about how exactly they count citations, such as whether self-citations or non-academic citations (e.g., on a secondary article or blog post) are counted.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> <ul> <li>Once you have claimed/created your profile, you will need to manually verify that all included articles on your profile are correct.</li> <li>It automatically combines pre-prints with the final published manuscript. If it fails to do that, you can manually merge the versions.</li> <li>You can add keywords on your profile relevant to your research.</li> <li>If desired, add co-authors from your manuscripts.</li> <li>You can link to a personal website.</li> </ul> </li> <li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net">Research Gate</a> <ul> <li>Create an account and verify if articles are correct.</li> <li>Offers an about me section where you can describe your current research goals.</li> <li>You can link to a personal website.</li> </ul> </li> <li><a href="https://orcid.org">ORCiD</a> <ul> <li>An ORCiD number is higly recommneded for any scientist as it assigns to you a unique identifier that can be linked to all of your publications, allowing easier indexing by these citation tracking platforms.</li> <li>You can search for your articles or manually add them.</li> <li>Also useful to add education and employment history here.</li> <li>You can link to a personal website.</li> </ul> </li> <li><a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org">SemanticScholar</a> <ul> <li>A newer site that typically shows a lower citation count, but tracks what it refers to as “highly influential citations” that demonstrate your work has heavily influenced other researchers.</li> <li>Same as with the others, manually select your articles. It seems to have lower article coverage than other sites so they may not be found. If so, you can request to have them added through your account settings.</li> <li>You can link to ORCiD and a personal website.</li> </ul> </li> <li><a href="https://www.webofscience.com">Web of Science</a> (formerly Publons) <ul> <li>Not as commonly used and has some features paywalled.</li> </ul> </li> <li><a href="https://www.scopus.com">Scopus</a> <ul> <li>Fairly new and also largely paywalled. Likely not worth curating.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h1 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h1> <p>Using the same profile picture on each site will allow readers to easily distinguish your work. Of course using a professional headshot is recommended.</p> <p>Besides curating your publications on sites that automatically aggregate them, there are other worthwhile places to keep an exhaustive or abridged list of works. A personal, academic oriented website where you have full control over how your work is presented is great for maintaining a complete list of authorship (including unpublished abstracts) if you have the coding skills to do so, or you can use a template site. However, setting up a personal website is beyond the scope of this article.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="research"/><category term="research"/><category term="science"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[a brief guide on curating your work as a scientist]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Optimizing Apex Legends for playing on Linux systems</title><link href="https://sclayton33.github.io/blog/2022/optimize-apex-linux/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Optimizing Apex Legends for playing on Linux systems"/><published>2022-11-27T08:39:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-27T08:39:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sclayton33.github.io/blog/2022/optimize-apex-linux</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sclayton33.github.io/blog/2022/optimize-apex-linux/"><![CDATA[<p>With the progress made largely by Valve and other developers on the compatability layer <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton">Proton</a>, it is now possible to play many games on Linux that historically have been unplayable. With their push for some anti-cheat support (namely Easy Anti-Cheat and Battleye) leading up to the Steam Deck release, many games with anti-cheat are now also playable. Apex Legends being one of them.</p> <p>This brief article will highlight some things you can try to optimize your gameplay experience on Linux.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="steam-tweaks">Steam tweaks</h2> <p>1.) Set launch options</p> <p>Right-click on Apex Legends in Steam &gt; properties &gt; general &gt; launch options.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>dxvk_hud=compiler gamemoderun %command% -novid -high +fps_max 96
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Descriptions of commands:</p> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dxvk_hud=compiler</code> <ul> <li>Only displays when shaders are being compiled</li> </ul> </li> <li><a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gamemoderun</code></a> <ul> <li>Produces on-demand performance boosts for games.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-novid</code> <ul> <li>Not a performance benefit perse, but saves you a few seconds each launch by not watching the splash screen.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-high</code> <ul> <li>Sets high process priority for the game. This may be redundant as gamemoderun should increase priority.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+fps_max 96</code></p> <ul> <li>Set this to your monitors refresh rate minus 4, e.g. if it’s 100, you would put 96. This should help prevent tearing and stutter.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>2.) Proton experimental</p> <p>Switching to the experimental branch may offer some performance improvements. You can also use the <em>bleeding-edge</em> branch, which I do personally. To switch to it, go to your steam library &gt; set filter to tools &gt; find Proton Experimental in the list &gt; right-click &gt; properties &gt; Betas &gt; bleeding-edge.</p> <p>It’s important to note that you <strong>should not use bleeding-edge for every game</strong> and back up your game prefixes before using it. I won’t explain how to do that here though.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="desktop-environment">Desktop Environment</h2> <p>Unlike on Windows, you have many options for different desktop environments on Linux. Your choice may impact how well games perform and how responsive they feel.</p> <p>After trying out many different combinations, here is what I feel to be the best:</p> <ul> <li>KDE Plasma X11 <ul> <li>These settings are not relevant if you are using Wayland.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Compositing turned off <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt + shift + F12</code> will enable/disable it.</li> <li>Check if it’s disabled by running this from command line, false means it is disabled. <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">qdbus org.kde.KWin /Compositor org.kde.kwin.Compositing.active</code></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Hopefully this helps your games!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="computer"/><category term="linux"/><category term="gaming"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[short guide outlining some methods to improve the gameplay experience on Linux]]></summary></entry></feed>
