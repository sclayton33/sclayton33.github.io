I am grateful to be quoted in the [Feared and Revered: All Eyes On AI](https://magazine.wvu.edu/stories/2024/02/26/feared-and-revered) article by WVU Magazine, along with fellow lab members about the work we did on our data analysis tool [CLAMS Wrangler](https://github.com/PistilliLab/CLAMSwrangler-web) which we developed to speed up data processing for ourselves and other researchers.
