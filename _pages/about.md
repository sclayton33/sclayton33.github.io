Hello! My name is Stuart. I am a biomedical researcher, programmer, and all-around tech/science nerd.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Pathophysiology, Rehabilitation and Performance at West Virginia University. My primary research focus is on understanding the effects of breast cancer on skeletal muscle metabolism and subsequent fatigue, both in terms of metabolome and mitochondrial dysfunction. With the hopes that this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the pathology of fatigue and identify actionable treatment targets.

My secondary interests center around the application of computational approaches to biomedical problems. In particular I enjoy learning about bioinformatics and applying those skills wherever possible in both my own research and through collaborations. As well as furthering my programming skills by developing software to analyze biological data.

Here you can find many totally interesting things:

- Blog posts that can range widely in topics but will likely focus around medicine, programming, or gaming.
- A list of all publications and abstracts I am authored on.
- Details about any projects that I may be working on.
- My full CV with education history, work experience, research experience, and other things of note.
- Any educational materials that I may create along the way.

If you would like to contact me, I can be best reached by email or LinkedIn.

Thanks for looking!
