Hello! My name is Stuart. I am a biomedical researcher, programmer, and all-around tech/science nerd. 

Here you can find many totally interesting things:
- Blog posts that can range widely in topics but will likely focus around medicine, programming, or gaming. They may or may not be opinionated. 
- A list of all [publications](https://sclayton33.github.io/publications) I am authored on. 
- Details about any projects that I may be working on.
- My full CV with education history, work experience, research experience, and other things of note.
- Any educational materials that I may create along the way.

Thanks for looking!
