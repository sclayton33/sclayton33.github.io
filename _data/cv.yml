      description:
        - title: Effects of breast cancer on skeletal muscle fatigue
          contents:
            - The significance of this research is to first establish if skeletal muscle fatigue occurs in the absence of cachexia. Secondly, the aim is to establish the underlying mechanisms as to how this muscle fatigue progresses.
            - Implant existing female breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) into NSG mice for our current tumor model.
            - Currently working on establishing male breast cancer PDXs in NSG mice to examine any sex differences in skeletal muscle physiology.
        - title: Technical skills learned
          contents:
            - Castration, RNA isolation, RNA-seq analysis.

      description:
        - title: Acute effects of e-cigarette exposure on peripheral vascular function.
          contents:
            - The significance of this research is to further understanding of the impacts of ecigarette use on the cardiovascular system.
            - Performed surgical procedures on rats.
            - Used ultrasound on rats to measure flow-mediated dilation.
    - title: Undergraduate research assistant in lab of Dr. Sergiy Yakovenko

        - title: Effects of depression and stress on cardiovascular system in rats.
          contents:
            - The significance of this project is the potential information it can yield on determining the largest areas of risk for developing cardiovascular disease in individuals with chronic depression and/or high stress.
            - Performed basic nutritional, medical, and physiological tasks on laboratory rats.
            - Performed post-mortem macro- and microsurgery procedures. Macro includes organ removal and sectioning of excised organs. Micro includes removal of superficial brain vessels under a microscope.
            - Performed assays on tissue samples, such as western blot and immuno-fluorescence.
            - Data analysis.
        - title: Influence of electronic cigarettes on vascular function in mice.
          contents:
            - This research is significant because at the moment very little is known about the long-term effects of e-cigarettes on the vascular system.
            - Analyzed ultrasound echo-cardiography and pulse-wave velocity data from mice.
