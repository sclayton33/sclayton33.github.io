  abstract={Proponents for electronic cigarettes (Ecigs) claim that they are a safe alternative to tobacco-based cigarettes; however, little is known about the long-term effects of exposure to E-cig vapor on vascular function. The purpose of this study was to determine the cardiovascular consequences of chronic E-cig exposure. Female mice (C57BL/6 background strain) were randomly assigned to chronic daily exposure to E-cig vapor, standard (3R4F reference) cigarette smoke, or filtered air (n = 15/group). Respective whole body exposures consisted of four 1-h-exposure time blocks, separated by 30-min intervals of fresh air breaks, resulting in intermittent daily exposure for a total of 4 h/day, 5 days/wk for 8 mo. Noninvasive ultrasonography was used to assess cardiac function and aortic arterial stiffness (AS), measured as pulse wave velocity, at three times points (before, during, and after chronic exposure). Upon completion of the 8-mo exposure, ex vivo wire tension myography and force transduction were used to measure changes in thoracic aortic tension in response to vasoactive-inducing compounds. AS increased 2.5- and 2.8-fold in E-cig- and 3R4F-exposed mice, respectively, compared with air-exposed control mice (P < 0.05). The maximal aortic relaxation to methacholine was 24% and 33% lower in E-cig- and 3R4F-exposed mice, respectively, than in controls (P < 0.05). No differences were noted in sodium nitroprusside dilation between the groups. 3R4F exposure altered cardiac function by reducing fractional shortening and ejection fraction after 8 mo (P < 0.05). A similar, although not statistically significant, tendency was also observed with E-cig exposure (P < 0.10). Histological and respiratory function data support emphysema-associated changes in 3R4F-exposed, but not E-cig-exposed, mice. Chronic exposure to E-cig vapor accelerates AS, significantly impairs aortic endothelial function, and may lead to impaired cardiac function. The clinical implication from this study is that chronic use of E-cigs, even at relatively low exposure levels, induces cardiovascular dysfunction.},

  title={Vaping to Vascular Damage: The Role of E-Cigarettes on Vascular Function [abstract]},

  abstract={
  Electronic cigarettes (E-cigs) have exponentially increased in popularity and usage due to the perception that e-cigs are safe, their usefulness as a cigarette-smoking cessation tool, and the appeal of heavily marketed flavors. There is little known about the long-term effects of E-cig vapor exposure, particularly in the context of vascular dysfunction. We hypothesize that the long-term use of E-cig vapor decreased aortic function, and increase aortic stiffness.
  Data were obtained from C57BL/6 female mice exposed to 3R4F reference cigarette (N=5–7), cappuccino flavored E-vapor (18 mg/ml nicotine, N=7), or filtered air (N=7–8) for 4 h/day, 5 d/wk for 8 months. Food and water were administered ad libitum. Before and after the exposure, in-vivo aortic stiffness (pulse wave velocity) was measured using B-mode and Doppler ultrasound by obtain blood flow signals at the aortic arch and before the carotid bifurcation from a single image, which were gated to the EKG. At the end of the exposure the thoracic aorta was dissected, sectioned into rings and mounted onto an ex-vivo wire tension myograph system. Force transduction was used to measure the changes in aortic tension in response to methacholine, or sodium nitroprusside.
  Aortic stiffness increased (0.45±0.20 m/s) in the air-exposed group, reflecting the normal aging process. However, an accelerated age-associated aortic stiffness was noted in the cigarette (1.28±0.27 m/s) and E-cig (1.14±0.24 m/s) groups (ANOVA, p<0.05). In animals exposed to filtered air, the maximal aortic relaxation achieved to methacholine was 90\%, compared to 60\% and 70\% in the cigarette and E-cig groups, respectively (p<0.05). No differences were noted in sodium nitroprusside dilation between groups.
  Our data suggests that 8 months of E-cig significantly accelerated the age-associated increase in aortic stiffness, and significantly impaired aortic endothelial-dependent but not endothelial-independent dilation. These data show the E-cigs induce similar vascular dysfunction to cigarette smoke exposure suggesting that E-cig have similar risk to develop accelerated cardiovascular aging and disease.},
