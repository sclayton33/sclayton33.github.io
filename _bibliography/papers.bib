  abstract={Proponents for electronic cigarettes (Ecigs) claim that they are a safe alternative to tobacco-based cigarettes; however, little is known about the long-term effects of exposure to E-cig vapor on vascular function. The purpose of this study was to determine the cardiovascular consequences of chronic E-cig exposure. Female mice (C57BL/6 background strain) were randomly assigned to chronic daily exposure to E-cig vapor, standard (3R4F reference) cigarette smoke, or filtered air (n = 15/group). Respective whole body exposures consisted of four 1-h-exposure time blocks, separated by 30-min intervals of fresh air breaks, resulting in intermittent daily exposure for a total of 4 h/day, 5 days/wk for 8 mo. Noninvasive ultrasonography was used to assess cardiac function and aortic arterial stiffness (AS), measured as pulse wave velocity, at three times points (before, during, and after chronic exposure). Upon completion of the 8-mo exposure, ex vivo wire tension myography and force transduction were used to measure changes in thoracic aortic tension in response to vasoactive-inducing compounds. AS increased 2.5- and 2.8-fold in E-cig- and 3R4F-exposed mice, respectively, compared with air-exposed control mice (P < 0.05). The maximal aortic relaxation to methacholine was 24% and 33% lower in E-cig- and 3R4F-exposed mice, respectively, than in controls (P < 0.05). No differences were noted in sodium nitroprusside dilation between the groups. 3R4F exposure altered cardiac function by reducing fractional shortening and ejection fraction after 8 mo (P < 0.05). A similar, although not statistically significant, tendency was also observed with E-cig exposure (P < 0.10). Histological and respiratory function data support emphysema-associated changes in 3R4F-exposed, but not E-cig-exposed, mice. Chronic exposure to E-cig vapor accelerates AS, significantly impairs aortic endothelial function, and may lead to impaired cardiac function. The clinical implication from this study is that chronic use of E-cigs, even at relatively low exposure levels, induces cardiovascular dysfunction.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
