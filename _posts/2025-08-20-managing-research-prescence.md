The world has long since entered the digital age, dragging nearly all scientific literature and data along with it. Online-only journals are exceedingly common today, if not the norm. As a result of this paradigm shift in scientific publishing, it is easier than ever to directly claim credit for your work on accounts that you can manage. Citation tracking platforms such as [Google Scholar](), [Research Gate](), [ORCiD](), and others provide a means of easy access to your entire body of scientific contributions.

However, these systems are imperfect. They may erroneously include papers under your name that are not yours, or fail to include papers that are. Unless your parents tried way too hard and gave you an absurdly unique name, there are plenty of other scientists that share your name. Thus, manual curation is required to ensure that these pages accurately represent your works.
